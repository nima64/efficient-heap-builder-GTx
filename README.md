This was made to verify **Data Structures & Algorithms II** build a heap program.
I wanted to see if the naive program was actually slower when the set was ordered, so I wrote the test.
The test runs the algothrims against a ordered set size of 10000

as you can see the naive program is log(n) complexity while the effecient one is 2n
